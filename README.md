# Learning C++
This repository shows my progress on learning C++. I create a folder (VS project) for each day, so you can track down any time what I'm up to. Currently I'm following TheCherno playlist, which is super rewarding and I definitely recommend to watch it even if you think you understand C++, since he explains lots of stuff I've never heard anyone talking about before. Anyways, this repository was created more for personal use, so there's nothing really important, although I will explain each project I make.
