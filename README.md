# Learning C++
This repository shows my progress on learning C++. I create a folder (VS project) for each day, so you can track down any time what I'm up to. Currently I'm following TheCherno playlist, which is super rewarding and I definitely recommend to watch it even if you think you understand C++, since he explains lots of stuff I've never heard anyone talking about before. Anyways, this repository was created more for personal use, so there's nothing really important, although I will explain each project I make.

## Day 1
Wrote a simple **Hello World!** program. This day was more of learning how C++ works under the hood, didn't really write any stuff there. Anyways, here's what I've learnt:

- ⚙️ How the C++ works
- ⚙️ How the C++ compiler works
- 🔗 How the C++ linker works

## Day 2
Wrote a simple **Hello World!** program, this time utilizing `log()` function I've created. Here's what I've learnt:

- ✍️ Variables
- 🎡 Functions
- 🎧 Header files
- 🛠️ How to debug in VS
- 💭 Conditions and branches

## Day 3
Wrote a program that finds pattern in the file(s). Usage:
```cmd
day3.exe "some pattern" file1 file2 ...
```

In case you want to make it case insensitive (so it won't matter if the match is lowercase or uppercase) - add `-i` flag:
```cmd
day3.exe "some pattern" file1 file2 ... -i
```

Except for this, today I've also learnt the following:
- 🔁 Loops *(for, while)*
- 🔁 Control flow *(continue, break, return)*
- ➡️ Pointers
- ➡️ References
- 🧱 Classes & Structs
