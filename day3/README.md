## Day 3
Today I wrote a program that finds pattern in the file(s). Usage:
```cmd
day3.exe "some pattern" file1 file2 ...
```

In case you want to make it case insensitive (so it won't matter if the match is lowercase or uppercase) - add `-i` flag:
```cmd
day3.exe "some pattern" file1 file2 ... -i
```

Except for this, today I've also learnt the following:
- 🔁 Loops *(for, while)*
- 🔁 Control flow *(continue, break, return)*
- ➡️ Pointers
- ➡️ References
- 🧱 Classes & Structs
